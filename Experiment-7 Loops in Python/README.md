# **Experiment 7: Study of Loops in Python**

**Name:** Drishti Heda

**PRN:** 25070123045

**Batch:** EnTC A-3

---

## **Title**

To study different types of loops in Python.

---

## **Aim**

To understand and implement looping constructs in Python such as for loop, while loop, nested loops, and loop control statements for solving programming problems efficiently.

---

## **Objectives**

* To understand the concept of iteration.
* To learn syntax and working of for and while loops.
* To implement nested loops.
* To understand break and continue statements.
* To apply loops in real programming scenarios.

---

## **Theory**

Loops are control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a given condition. They help reduce repetition and improve program efficiency.

### **1. While Loop**

A while loop executes statements as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:

```
while condition:
    statements
```

### **2. For Loop**

Used when number of iterations is known.

```
for variable in sequence:
    statements
```

### **3. Nested Loops**

Loop inside another loop; useful for patterns, matrices, etc.

### **4. Loop Control Statements**

* **Break:** exits loop immediately.
* **Continue:** skips current iteration.

## **Programs Covered**

* Number printing using loops
* Factorial calculation
* Fibonacci series
* Armstrong number
* Prime number checking
* Pattern printing
* Matrix operations
* Digit combinations
* Use of break and continue

## **Conclusion**

In this experiment, looping concepts in Python were studied and implemented. Different types of loops such as for loops, while loops, and nested loops were used to solve various programming problems. Loop control statements enhanced understanding of program flow and logic building.
